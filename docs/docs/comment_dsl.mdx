# Comment DSL

We have a comment DSL to help annotate the output code beyond what is possible just with CDDL.

## @name

For example in an array-encoded group you can give explicit names just by the keys e.g.:
```cddl
foo = [
    bar: uint,
    baz: text
]
```
but with map-encoded structs the keys are stored and for things like integer keys this isn't very helpful e.g.:
```cddl
tx = {
  ? 0: [* input],
  ? 1: [* outputs],
}
```
we would end up with two fields: `key_0` and `key_1`. We can instead end up with fields named `inputs` and `outputs` by doing:
```cddl
tx = {
  ? 0: [* input],   ; @name inputs
  ? 1: [* outputs], ; @name outputs
}
```
Note: the parsing can be finicky. For struct fields you must put the comment AFTER the comma, and the comma must exist even for the last field in a struct.

It is also possible to use `@name` with type choices:
```cddl
foo = 0 ; @name mainnet
    / 1 ; @name testnet
```
and also for group choices:
```cddl
script = [
  ; @name native
  tag: 0, script: native_script //
  ; @name plutus_v1
  tag: 1, script: plutus_v1_script //
  ; @name plutus_v2
  tag: 2, script: plutus_v2_script
]
```

## @newtype

With code like `foo = uint` this creates an alias e.g. `pub type Foo = u64;` in rust. When we use `foo = uint ; @newtype` it instead creates a `pub struct Foo(u64);`.

## @no_alias

```cddl
foo = uint
bar = [
  field: foo
]
```
This would normally result in:
```rust
pub type Foo = u64;
pub struct Bar {
    field: Foo,
}
```
but if we use `@no_alias` it skips generating an alias and uses it directly e.g.:
```cddl
foo = uint ; @no_alias
bar = [
  field: foo
]
```
to
```rust
pub struct Bar {
    field: u64,
}
```

## _CDDL_CODEGEN_EXTERN_TYPE_

While not as a comment, this allows you to compose in hand-written structs into a cddl spec.
```cddl
foo = _CDDL_CODEGEN_EXTERN_TYPE_
bar = [
    x: uint,
    y: foo,
]
```
This will treat `Foo` as a type that will exist and that has implemented the `Serialize` and `Deserialize` traits, so the (de)serialization logic in `Bar` here will call `Foo::serialize()` and `Foo::deserialize()`.
This can also be useful when you have a spec that is either very awkward to use (so you hand-write or hand-modify after generation) in some type so you don't generate those types and instead manually merge those hand-written/hand-modified structs back in to the code afterwards. This saves you from having to manually remove all code that is generated regarding `Foo` first before merging in your own.

## _CDDL_CODEGEN_RAW_BYTES_TYPE_

Allows encoding as `bytes` but imposing hand-written constraints defined elsewhere.
```cddl
foo = _CDDL_CODEGEN_RAW_BYTES_TYPE_
bar = [
    foo,
]
```
This will treat `foo` as some external type called `Foo`. This type must implement the exported (in `serialization.rs`) trait `RawBytesEncoding`.
This can be useful for example when working with cryptographic primtivies e.g. a hash or pubkey, as it allows users to have those crypto structs be from a crypto library then they only need to implement the trait for them and they will be able to be directly used without needing any useless generated wrapper struct for the in between.
